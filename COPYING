The computer code MC ("The Code") was developed by individuals listed in
the "AUTHORS" file ("The Author"), located in the same place you found this 
"COPYING" file.  The Code is NOT in the public domain, and is NOT covered by 
any type of GNU or BSD-style license.  It is copyrighted software, and 
The Author holds all copyrights.

As a result, The Author is the sole owner of the rights to use, modify, 
and distribute The Code.  What this means is that under U.S. and
International Law, you can be prosecuted for copyright violation and
intellectual property theft if you use, modify, and/or distribute The Code 
without express written permission from The Author.

Since The Code represents several years (5 years of direct work, plus 
many previous years of indirect work) of The Author's life energy, he is 
pretty serious about the copyright; please respect it.  If you hear about 
The Code and would like to use it, please drop The Author an email or 
phone him up; he almost never refuses such a request.

This is a not-for-profit effort; the whole point is to do academic science.
However, the rules of the game involve publication of papers, procuring
grants, obtaining tenure, etc., which makes it necessary to protect one's
work using copyrights and so on.

====================================================
Licensing, permission to use, modify, and distribute
====================================================

If you are using The Code, then you must have been given permission to use
The Code by The Author personally; otherwise, you are violating the
copyright (and the law).

If The Author agrees to give you permission to use The Code, you must agree
to the following conditions:

   (i)   You will not distribute The Code in any form to anyone else,
         either electronically, in hardcopy form, or in any other form,
         without permission of The Author.

   (ii)  You will not distribute any modified versions of The Code to
         anyone else; these are considered "DERIVATIVE WORKS" under U.S.
         and International Law, and are therefore covered by the original
         copyright.

   (iii) You will acknowledge the use of The Code in any research
         publications containing results using The Code.

WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING

TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
