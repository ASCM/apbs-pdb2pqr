The 35,000+ lines were written and debugged by the author primarily
on a 90Mhz Pentium PC with a FireGL video card running Linux, using
only GNU software development tools.

A number of generous and gifted people have contributed pieces of code to MC,
and are listed below, alongside their contributions.  Each author retains the
copyrights to the individual pieces of code which they contribute to MC,
in the GNU spirit.

NOTE: At this time, MC is NOT being freely distributed.  Please read the

================================================
Other software included with the MC distribution
================================================

While not required to compile or use MC, several other packages (or subsets
of packages) are included with the MC distribution.  Each of these packages
has a separate set of developers, and may have its own redistribution rules;
see the appropriate subdirectories in the source tree.  The extra packages 
are as follows:

   <MC_ROOT/src/vgm/pred.c> -- J. Shewchuk's geometric "predicates.c"
   <MC_ROOT/src/ef/*>       -- B. Perens' Electric Fence (A malloc debugger)
   <MC_ROOT/src/glw/*>      -- B. Paul's GLw widgets (An OpenGL "GLw" widget)
   <MC_ROOT/src/vblas/*>    -- Subset of the CBLAS library (C version of BLAS)
   <MC_ROOT/src/vor/*>      -- Subset of K. Clarkson's HULL (delaunay code)
   <MC_ROOT/src/vsav/*>     -- Subset of D. Bashford's SAV (SolvAccVol)
   <MC_ROOT/src/vslu/*>     -- Subset of SuperLU library (sparse direct solver)


===============================
Redistributing MC (PLEASE READ)
===============================

Please read the "copying" file included with MC.  Here is a brief summary:

      MC is not a yet GNU code; it is not yet covered by the GNU GPL.
                  
I.e., MC is not currently redistributable, AT ALL.  In particular, I do not
want my contributions redistributed yet, AT ALL (until after tenure :).  If
you decide to let other people use any MC-related code that YOU write, please
remember that unless we have an a priori agreement, you are NOT allowed to
distribute any of the core MC libraries that I have written.  While this
policy will change, MC is currently NOT a redistributable code.

===============================================
Guidelines for Contributing to MC (PLEASE READ)
===============================================

If you are using MC and have written a new method for one of the MC class
libraries, or if you have simply made a change to an existing method, and
you would like your changes to be added permanently to the master CVS archive
which I use to maintain MC (so that your changes or additions will be
available to you and others in the future), please contact me about this.

Here are the rules you must agree to live by in order to have your
contribution included permanently in the CVS source tree:

   (1) The contribution must add significant new or improved functionality
       to MC (to keep the number of changes I must deal with managable).
       Minor changes or small bug fixes to existing class libraries will
       be gladly accepted, but your name will not necessarily be added
       to the author list unless the changes are significant.

   (2) The contribution must be general in nature, and must not build in
       problem-specific details into the core MC libraries.  (Of course, if
       your contribution is a PDE description file, then it can be very
       problem specific.)

   (3) The contribution must adhere to the "Clean C" coding style guidelines
       listed in the file "hacking", and it must be consistent with the
       overall coding style and design of MC.

   (4) Any changes you make must be completely documented in the header block
       of each individual method that you modify.  In addition, your name
       should be added to the list of authors in the header block for the
       specific method (so that you can be held accountable later :), and your
       contributions should be (briefly) summarized on the line containing
       your name.  You retain the copyrights to your contribution (see below).
       You do not need to edit the 20-line copyright notice at the top of the
       files in MC (it is automatically generated by a shell script, and any
       changes you make to those 20 lines will be lost).

   (5) You must agree to license your contribution to me and to the world
       under the GNU GPL (the GNU General Public License).  This means that
       you retain the copyright to your specific code contribution, but it
       makes it possible for me and others to use your code in MC, and it
       protects you in the sense that anyone attempting to sell your
       contributions for profit must also make available, on request, your
       original source code with your author information attached.  If you
       later decide to change your contribution to a non-GPL license, I will
       remove your contribution from MC (no offense taken).  Please read the
       "copying.gnu" file for details about the GNU GPL.

   (6) The primary author (Michael Holst) makes all final decisions regarding
       (a) additions or changes to the CVS source tree, (b) major design
       changes, and (c) the overall development direction for MC.
