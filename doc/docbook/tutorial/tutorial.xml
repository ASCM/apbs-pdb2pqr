    <warning>
      <para>This is my first attempt at a tutorial and it is actively under
        development.  Please let me know if you encounter any problems;
        suggestions about modifications/additions are always welcome.
      </para>
    </warning>


    <para>
      This tutorial is designed to help users get acquainted with
      computational electrostatics calculations using APBS.  In order to
      perform the provided examples, you will need:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            The latest version of APBS 
            (<ulink url="http://agave.wustl.edu">http://agave.wustl.edu</ulink>)
            to perform the electrostatics calculations.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            VMD 
            (<ulink url="http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/">http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/</ulink>)
            to visualize the molecular structures and electrostatic
            potentials.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Gnuplot
            (<ulink url="http://www.gnuplot.info/">http://www.gnuplot.info/</ulink>)
            to plot energies, etc.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Bash (<ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/bash.html">http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/bash.html</ulink>; standard on most
            Linux, MacOS X)
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Python (<ulink url="http://www.python.org/">http://www.python.org/</ulink>; standard on most
            Linux, MacOS X)
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      Furthermore, these examples all assume that the above programs are in
      your system path (i.e., can be run simply by typing the program name).
    </para>

    <para>
      The following examples demonstrate some of the basic electrostatics
      which require modest computational resources; i.e., can be performed
      using in 0-5 min on a modern PC.  
      <important>
        <para> These examples build on one another and are designed to be
          carried out in order.  Please read through each section completely
          before trying the example.  
        </para>
      </important>
      <warning>
        <para> This tutorial require several files (linked to from the
          individual examples) be downloaded.  It is recommended that you
          create a separate subdirectory (e.g., 
          <userinput>mkdir foo; cd foo</userinput>) for each example.  Also
          many browsers will display, rather than save the example files.
          Right-clicking on the link (or the displayed file) should present
          you with the option to save the file.

  <chapter>  <title>More examples...</title>
    <para>  In addition to the relatively simple applications presented here,
      there are a number of additional examples distributed with the APBS
      software package 
      (<ulink
        url="http://agave.wustl.edu/apbs/">http://agave.wustl.edu/apbs/</ulink>)
      which include ionization energies, protein-protein interactions, parallel 
      calculations, etc.
