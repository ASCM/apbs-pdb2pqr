	<chapter id="introduction-sect"> <title>How to read this tutorial</title>

		<para>This tutorial is designed as a "how to" document to get
			users acquainted with computational electrostatics
			calculations using APBS.  In order to perform the
			provided examples, you will need the latest version of
			APBS (<ulink url="&apbsurl;">&apbsurl;</ulink>).  Other
			requirements are listed in the individual
			sections.</para>

		<important>
			<para>Note that many of the examples in this tutorial
				can also be run through the web-based <ulink
					url="http://gemstone.mozdev.org/">Gemstone</ulink>
				service without the need for local
				installations of the APBS software.  More
				information is available in <xref

	<chapter id="pdb2pqr-sect"> <title>How do I get my structure ready for
			electrostatics calculations?</title>

		<para>
			In order to perform electrostatics calculations on your
			biomolecular structure of interest, you need to provide
			atomic charge and radius information to APBS.  Charges
			are used to form the biomolecular charge distribution
			for the Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation while the radii
			are used to construct the dielectric and ionic
			accessibility functions.  This charge and radius
			information can be provided to APBS in a few different
			formats which are described in more detail below.
		</para>

		<sect1 id="pqr-format-sect"> <title>PQR format</title>
			<para>
				The <ulink url="&ugurl;#pqr-format">PQR
					format</ulink> provides a very simple
				way to include parameter information by 
				by replacing the occupancy and temperature
				columns of a PDB-format structure file with 
				charge ("Q") and radius ("R") information.
				Unfortunately, the simplicity of this format
				also limits its extensibility:  it can be very
				difficult to add new atom types and parameters
				in a generic format without the use of external
				software such as <ulink
					url="&pdb2pqrurl;">PDB2PQR</ulink>.
				The XML parameter format described <link
					linkend="xml-format-sect">below</link>
				is much easier to modify.

				files (PDB2PQR)</title>

			<para>
				The <ulink url="&pdb2pqrurl;">PDB2PQR</ulink>
				web service and software will convert
				most PDB files into PQR format with
				some caveats:
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							Limited ligand support.
							Given the ambiguities
							associated with
							implicit solvent force
							field parameter
							development, atom types
							not included in

					<listitem>
						<para>
							Inability to "repair"

							Although PDB2PQR can

				<ulink url="&pdb2pqrurl;">PDB2PQR</ulink> will

	<chapter id="viz-sect"> <title>How do I visualize the electrostatic
potential around my biomolecule?</title>

		<para> There are a number of excellent molecular graphics
			programs which can be used to visualize electrostatic
			properties in the context of the biomolecule.  Since
			there are far too many to review in any depth, we will
			focus on the 3 packages with which we are most
			familiar. </para>

		<sect1 id="vmd-sect"> <title>VMD</title>

			<para>
				The <ulink url="&vmdurl;">VMD</ulink> molecular
				graphics software package provides support for
				both the execution of APBS and the
				visualization of the resulting electrostatic
				potentials.  Documentation on the APBS
				interface has been provided by the VMD
				developers at <ulink
					url="http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/plugins/apbsrun/">http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/plugins/apbsrun/</ulink>.
				We will supplement this with a basic
				demonstration of how go from a PDB entry to a
				plot of structure &amp; potential in VMD using
				APBS.
			</para>

			<note>
				<para>This tutorial was written using VMD
					1.8.5.</para>
			</note>

			<sect2> <title>Generating the PQR</title>

				<para> 
					We'll perform this example with arc
					repressor
					(PDB ID <ulink
						url="http://www.pdb.org/pdb/explore.do?structureId=1MYK">1MYK</ulink>),
					a DNA binding protein.  The first step
					in the visualization process is
					generating a PQR file for use with VMD
					and APBS.  We will generate this input
					file via <ulink
						url="&pdb2pqrurl;">PDB2PQR</ulink>
					(described in more detail in <xref
						linkend="pdb2pqr-sect"/>).
				</para>

				<para>
					Choose a server from <ulink
						url="&pdb2pqrurl;#availability">&pdb2pqrurl;#availability</ulink>
					and go to the web page for that server.
					Under "<guilabel>Please enter
						either:</guilabel>", select
					the "<guibutton>a PDB ID:</guibutton>"
					button and enter
					<userinput>1MYK</userinput> in the
					form.  Configure the rest of the
					PDB2PQR job to your liking<footnote>
						<para>I recommend the PARSE
							force field for these
							calculations;  you
							can leave the rest of
							defaults in
							place</para>
					</footnote>
					and press the
					"<guibutton>Submit</guibutton>" button.
					Depending on the server, the current
					load, etc. the job will take between
					30-120 sec.  Upon completion, you
					should see a link for your
					newly-created PQR file.  Download the
					file (and check the resulting file
					extension -- some browsers append
					".txt" to the filename).
				</para>

				<tip>
					<para>
						Dependending on your personal
						preference, you may want to
						remove the explicit water
						molecules from the PQR file
						before proceeding to the next
						step.
					</para>
				</tip>

				<para>
					Load the PQR file you just created into
					VMD (<menuchoice>
						<guimenu>File</guimenu> 
						<guimenuitem>New molecule...</guimenuitem>
					</menuchoice> in the VMD Main window).
					Adjust the molecule to the desired
					view.
					<footnote>
						<para> At this point you may
							notice (to many users'
							chagrin) that PDB2PQR
							removed the chain IDs
							from the structure.
							Sorry about this; we're
							trying to fix it in
							future releases of APBS
							and PDB2PQR.</para>
					</footnote>
					Depending on the force field you used
					in PDB2PQR, you may notice that VMD is
					displaying some strange bonds.  When a
					PQR file is loaded into VMD, bond
					distances are inferred from the PQR
					radii.  These radii were chosen for
					continuum electrostatics calculations,
					not visualization.  Don't worry if some
					of the bonds appear a bit strange (hide
					the hydrogens if it really bothers
					you).

				<para>Finally, return to the Calculation tab
