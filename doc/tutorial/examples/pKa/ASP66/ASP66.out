	APBS uses FETK (the Finite Element ToolKit) to solve the
	Poisson-Boltzmann equation numerically.  FETK is a portable collection
	of finite element modeling class libraries developed by the Michael Holst
	research group and written in an object-oriented form of C.  FEtk is
	designed to solve general coupled systems of nonlinear partial differential
	equations using adaptive finite element methods, inexact Newton methods,
	and algebraic multilevel methods.  More information about FEtk may be found
	at <http://www.FEtk.ORG>.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
	APBS also uses Aqua to solve the Poisson-Boltzmann equation numerically.  
	Aqua is a modified form of the Holst group PMG library <http://www.FEtk.ORG>
	which has been modified by Patrice Koehl
	<http://koehllab.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/> for improved efficiency and
	memory usage when solving the Poisson-Boltzmann equation.
